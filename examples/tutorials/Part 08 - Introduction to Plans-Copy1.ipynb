    "# Part 8 - Introduction to Plans\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context \n",
    "\n",
    "We introduce here an object which is crucial to scale to industrial Federated Learning: the Plan. It reduces dramatically the bandwidth usage, allows asynchronous schemes and give more autonomy to remote devices. The original concept of plan can be found in the paper [Towards Federated Learning at Scale: System Design](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.01046.pdf), but it has been adapted to our needs in the PySyft library.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Plan is intended to store a sequence of torch operations, just like a function, but it allows to send this sequence of operations to remote workers and to keep a reference to it. This way, to compute remotely this sequence of $n$ operations on some remote input referenced through pointers, instead of sending $n$ messages you need now to send a single message with the references of the plan and the pointers. You can also provide tensors with your function (that we call _state tensors_) to have extended functionalities. Plans can be seen either like a function that you can send, or like a class which can also be sent and executed remotely. Hence, for high level users, the notion of plan disappears and is replaced by a magic feature which allow to send to remote workers arbitrary functions containing sequential torch functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to notice is that the class of functions that you can transform into plans is currently limited to sequences of hooked torch operations exclusively. This excludes in particular logical structures like `if`, `for` and `while` statements, even if we are working to have workarounds soon. _To be completely precise, you can use these but the logical path you take (first `if` to False and 5 loops in `for` for example) in the first computation of your plan will be the one kept for all the next computations, which we want to avoid in the majority of cases._\n",
