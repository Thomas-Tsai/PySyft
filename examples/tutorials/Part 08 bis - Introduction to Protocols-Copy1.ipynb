    "### Context \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've been through Plans, we'll introduce a new object called the Protocol. A Protocol coordinates a sequence of Plans, deploys them on distant workers\n",
    "and run them in a single pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a high level object which contains the logic of a complex computation\n",
    "distributed across several workers. The main feature of Protocol is the\n",
    "ability to be sent / searched / fetched back between workers, and finally\n",
    "deployed to identified workers. So a user can design a protocol, upload it\n",
    "to a cloud worker, and any other workers will be able to search for it,\n",
    "download it, and apply the computation program it contains on the workers\n",
    "that it is connected to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how to use it!\n",
